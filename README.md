# 21-Search-Engine

## Description
A search engine for books created in React, a widely popular Javascript framework. It utilises GraphQL to make requests for data from the server but only what is queried. The use of the mutations function is that backend data can be updated as specifically as is necessary.  

## Usage

Invoke the following commands in each of the sub main subfolders.

```
npm i
```
You can then use the following commmand to run the site up.

```
npm run start
```

This application is deployed on GitHub pages.

## TODO:
* Add more queries 
* Hook up GraphQL in App.js so this functionality is being utilised.

## BUGS:
* No queries or mutations can be made yet.
